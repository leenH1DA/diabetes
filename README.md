ðŸ“Š Diabetes Prediction Web App â€“ Project Overview
ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a set of health indicators derived from the CDCâ€™s BRFSS 2015 dataset. The project leverages machine learning techniquesâ€”particularly the XGBoost classifierâ€”to build a predictive model, and presents the result through an interactive web application built with Streamlit.

The model is trained on a carefully selected subset of features using feature selection methods, enabling efficient and interpretable predictions based on a minimal number of key health indicators.
